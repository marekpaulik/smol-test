3. **JsonWriterPipeline**: This is a pipeline defined in "pipelines.py" and used in "settings.py" and "reddit_scraper.py" to handle the storage of scraped data in JSON format.

4. **Settings**: The settings defined in "settings.py" are used across all the other files to configure the behavior of the Scrapy spider.

5. **RedditSpider**: This is the main spider class defined in "reddit_spider.py" and used in "reddit_scraper.py" to handle the scraping process.

7. **Output.json**: This is the file where the scraped data is stored in a structured format. It is created and written to by the "JsonWriterPipeline" in "pipelines.py" and read by "reddit_scraper.py".
